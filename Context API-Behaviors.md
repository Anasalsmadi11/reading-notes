### How do useReducer and useContext work together to simplify state management in a React application? (At least two paragraphs of prose.)

useReducer and useContext are two React hooks that synergize to simplify state management. While useReducer offers a structured way to handle complex state updates through dispatched actions and a reducer function, useContext enables components to access state without prop drilling. By using useContext, you can consume state and dispatch actions from a context, making state sharing across components more efficient and maintaining a cleaner codebase. This combination streamlines state management and enhances modularity in React applications.
