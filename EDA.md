# Event Driven Applications

## [Event Driven Programming](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-event-driven-programming)

### What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

Node.js natively provides us with a useful module called EventEmitter that allows us to get started incorporating Event-Driven Programming in our project right away.

### What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

The value of combining Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Event-Driven Programming (EDP) is improved code organization, modularity, reusability, and maintainability in event-driven systems. It allows for structured event handling, encapsulation of functionality within objects, easier management of object state, and promotes code scalability and extensibility. 

### Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

Imagine you have a website or an application that many people use at the same time. When you click a button on that website or perform an action, the server behind it needs to respond quickly and handle multiple requests from different users all at once.

Event Driven Programming in the backend, using Node.js, helps the server do just that. It's like having a super-efficient team of workers that can handle many tasks simultaneously. Instead of doing one thing at a time and waiting for each task to finish before moving on to the next, the server can handle multiple things happening at once.
