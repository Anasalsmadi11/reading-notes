# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

## [AWS API Gateway Overview](https://www.serverless.com/guides/amazon-api-gateway)




### What is Amazon API Gateway?

Amazon API Gateway is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic. It also handles authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests.

### Why is Amazon API Gateway an important part of the Serverless ecosystem?

API Gateway sits between the backend services of your API and your APIâ€™s users, handling the HTTP requests(GET,POST,PUT, DELETE) to your API endpoints and routing them to the correct backends. 

### How does API Gateway integrate with other AWS services?

 IT acts as a front door for applications to access other AWS services and resources securely. It integrates seamlessly with various AWS services to provide a comprehensive solution for building, deploying, and managing APIs.

## [AWS DynamoDB Guide](https://www.dynamodbguide.com/what-is-dynamo-db/)



### What is DynamoDB?

DynamoDB is a hosted NoSQL database offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS)

### Under what circumstances would you recommend DynamoDB over MongoDB?

DynamoDB is a particularly good fit for the following use cases:

1. Applications with large amounts of data and strict latency requirements.
1. Serverless applications using AWS Lambda.
1. Data sets with simple, known access patterns.

### Explain to a non-technical friend how DynamoDB works.

Sure! Imagine DynamoDB as a magical bookshelf where you can store and retrieve any kind of information you want quickly and easily. It's like having a super-fast library that can instantly find the exact book you need, no matter how many books are on the shelf.
