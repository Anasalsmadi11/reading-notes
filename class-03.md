# Data Structures and Algorithms

### What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
the efficiency of the operations required by the problem.Different data structures excel at different types of operations. For example:
* Arrays are efficient when it comes to accessing elements by index,
* Linked lists are efficient for inserting and deleting elements at any position
* Hash tables provide fast access and retrieval of elements based on keys

### How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
we can implement proper termination conditions and ensure that our recursive function progresses toward the termination condition
