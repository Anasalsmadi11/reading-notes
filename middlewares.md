### Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.

Imagine you're a recruiter in charge of screening job applicants. When a candidate submits their application, it goes through several steps before reaching the final decision. Middleware functions similarly in a web application.

### Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?
Being "unopinionated" means that Express doesn't enforce any specific architectural patterns, coding conventions, or project structures upon developers

### What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers? 

In software development, a module refers to a self-contained and independent unit of code that performs a specific functionality or task

it is useful because it allow developers to break down complex systems into smaller, manageable units.

### What version of npm are you running on your machine?
**9.5.1**

### What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?

**npm i jshint**

## What is TDD?
“Test-driven development” refers to a style of programming in which three activities are tightly interwoven: coding, testing (in the form of writing unit tests) and design

### Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.

Imagine you're building a house—a beautiful, sturdy structure that you want to last for years to come. Now, before you move in and start living there, it's crucial to ensure that everything is in order and functions as intended. That's where code tests come into play.

### What are three expected benefits of testing

* Bug Detection and Prevention
* Improved Code Quality and Maintainability
* Time and Cost Savings

### Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.

**Typical individual mistakes include:**
* forgetting to run tests frequently
* writing too many tests at once

**Typical team pitfalls include:**
* partial adoption – only a few developers on the team use TDD
* poor maintenance of the test suite – most commonly leading to a test suite with a prohibitively long running time

## CI/CD

### What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?
1. Early Bug Detection and Faster Issue Resolution
2. Increased Collaboration and Team Efficiency
2. Rapid Feedback and Continuous Improvement

### What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?

* Continuous Delivery, the software is continuously built, tested, and prepared for deployment.

* In Continuous Deployment, the software is automatically deployed to the production environment as soon as it passes the necessary tests and checks. The entire process, from code integration to deployment, is automated without human intervention. 

### Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background


Imagine GitHub as a centralized platform, like a virtual workspace, where developers collaborate and store their code. It's like a big shared folder where everyone can contribute to a project. GitHub provides a place to store the code, track changes, and work together as a team.GitHub serves as a version control system.
