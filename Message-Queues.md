# Message Queues

## [Socket.io Chat Example](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/6888396/discussion_topics/18305207)



### Explain to a non-technical recruiter what the Chat Example (above) does.

simple chat application that allows users to send and receive messages in real-time. It's built using JavaScript and the Node.js web framework Express, along with the Socket.IO library for real-time communication.

### What proof of life are we getting on the backend from the above app?
1. Console Log: When the server starts listening, we have a console.log statement that outputs a message to the console.

2. Connection Event: We have a console.log statement inside the io.on('connection', ...) event listener, which gets triggered whenever a new client socket connects to the server. 

### Socket.IO gives us the i0.emit() method to send an event to everyone. What flag would you use if you want to send a message to everyone except for a certain emitting socket?


To send a message to everyone except for a certain emitting socket in Socket.IO, we can use the broadcast flag

## [Rooms](https://socket.io/docs/v4/rooms)


### What is a room and how might a room be useful?
A room is an arbitrary channel that sockets can join and leave. It can be used to broadcast events to a subset of clients

it can be useful in various ways:

1. Chat Applications
1. Video Conferencing
1. Collaborative Tools
1. Multiplayer Games: Rooms can be used in multiplayer gaming applications, providing a shared space where players can interact, compete, or cooperate with each other. 

### How do you join a room?

we can join  roons using join method:

*io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  socket.join("some room");
});*

### how do you leave a room?

we can leave  roonms using leave method

## [Namespaces](https://socket.io/docs/v4/namespaces/)


### What is a Namespace and what does it allow you to do?
A Namespace is a communication channel that allows you to split the logic of your application over a single shared connection,

### Each namespace potentially has its own what? (hint: 3 things)

Each namespace potentially has its own event handlers

### Discuss a possible use case for separate namespaces

Consider a real-time chat application that supports multiple chat rooms. Each chat room has its own set of users and conversations. In this scenario, you can utilize separate namespaces to handle the chat functionality for each room independently.
