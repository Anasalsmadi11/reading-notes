# Redux - Asynchronous Actions

## [async actions](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-6-async-logic)




### Why use Redux middleware?


Redux middleware is used to handle asynchronous actions and side effects in Redux applications. It acts as a bridge between the action creators and the reducers, allowing you to perform tasks like making API requests, handling timeouts, or dispatching additional actions based on the results of async operations. 

### Consider the Redux Async Data Flow Diagram. Describe the flow in your own words.

The Redux Async Data Flow Diagram illustrates how Redux handles asynchronous operations in a typical Redux application. 


**Action Creator:** Initiates async actions.

**Middleware:** Handles async operations and dispatches new actions.

**Async Operation:** Represents tasks like API requests.

**Dispatch New Actions:** Signals async progress and outcomes.

**Reducer:** Updates the state based on dispatched actions.

**Updated State:** Reflects changes in the UI.


### How are we accommodating async in our Redux app?

To accommodate async operations in a Redux application, you typically use middleware like Redux Thunk or Redux Saga. These middleware libraries provide the means to manage the flow of async actions by allowing you to dispatch actions at various points during the async operation's lifecycle.


## [thunk middleware](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)




### Why would you need redux-thunk middleware?

Redux Thunk middleware is useful when you need to handle asynchronous logic in your Redux action creators. It enables you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action.

### Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a ____ instead of an action.


Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action.

### Describe how any return value from the inner thunk function will be made available.

The return value from the inner thunk function can be made available through the use of a promise or through chaining callbacks.

When you dispatch a thunk action (a function) in Redux, the return value is typically not directly accessible, as Redux itself doesn't handle the return value of the dispatched thunk. Instead, you can make use of the promises or callbacks returned by asynchronous operations within the thunk to access the results of those operations.
